<Meta title="Getting Started/Installation" />

# Installation

To get started, install the AI library.

```bash
npm install @tylertech/forge-ai
```

## Framework Adapters

If you're using a framework, you should jump to the framework-specific guide:

- [React](?path=/docs/frameworks-react--docs)

## Importing Components

You will then need to import each of the components you are using within your application.

```javascript
import '@tylertech/forge-ai/ai-chat-interface';
```

> The above imports are known as "side effect" imports and will automatically register the components with the browser.
