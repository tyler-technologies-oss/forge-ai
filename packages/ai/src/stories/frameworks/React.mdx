# React

To make using Forge AI with React more seamless, we have created an adapter library to make communicating with the underlying custom elements easier.

This adapter library provides a thin wrapper React component around all Forge AI custom elements that allows you to pass data and listen to events in a more React-friendly way.

While the adapter is not _required_ to use Forge AI with React, it is **highly** recommended to make the integration easier.

> You can view source code for the Forge AI React adapter on [GitHub](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-ai/tree/main/packages/ai-react).

## React 19

If you're using React 19 or later, you can also use the custom elements directly in your application without the adapter library.

React 19 comes with built-in support for custom elements, but feel free to use the adapter regardless if you prefer!

## Installation

To use Forge AI in your React application, install the following packages from npm:

```bash
npm install @tylertech/forge-ai @tylertech/forge-ai-react
```

## Importing Components

To use Forge AI components in your React application, import the components you need from the `@tylertech/forge-ai-react` package, as well as the custom elements from `@tylertech/forge-ai`.

```jsx
import { ForgeAiChatInterface } from '@tylertech/forge-ai-react';

function App() {
  return <ForgeAiChatInterface></ForgeAiChatInterface>;
}
```
