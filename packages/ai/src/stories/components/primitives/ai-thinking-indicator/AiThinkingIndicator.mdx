<Title />

The AI Thinking Indicator is a specialized loading component designed for AI chat interfaces. It displays three animated dots that sequentially appear from left to right, then bounce in a wave pattern to indicate that the system is processing or awaiting a response.

## Usage

Use the AI Thinking Indicator when:

- The AI is processing a user's request
- Waiting for a response from an AI service
- During any period where the user should know the system is actively working

The component provides a smooth, engaging animation that keeps users informed without being distracting.

## Accessibility

The component respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting and provides a simplified animation for users who prefer reduced motion.
